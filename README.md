This is my hackpad! It is a musicpad, and it had 4 buttons to pause, replay, previous track, and next track, and a rotary encoder to control volume. It also has a OLED screen that will show the track title being played!

I created this macropad so I could easily navigate through a playlist, without having to having to stop what I'm doing to go to spotify in my browser. Though I have experience in CAD, this was my first time using Kicad. Though it took some time and research, I was able to get my pcb done!
